## A Mini-Version of GTea in C++

![CGTea](https://github.com/rostam/CGTea/blob/master/doc/images/image.png)

Welcome to CGTea, a mini-version of GTea written in C++. The view of this project is based on wxWidget. The library part (Model) and the controllers are still under development and need significant improvements. Currently, the focus is on implementing algorithms, reports, actions, and more, based on the Java code.

### Dependencies
There are three main dependencies for this project:

1. **Eigen Library**: This should be copied into the main directory.
2. **wxWidget**: This is needed for the graphical user interface. However, the core library parts can be used without this library.
3. **Boost Library**: This should be installed using the following command:
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essentials libboost-all-dev libmetis-dev metis
    ```

Please note that the project is in active development, and contributions are welcome. For more information, please refer to the source code and comments therein.
